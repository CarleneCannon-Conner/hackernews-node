# how-to-graphql-tutorial (Still a work in progress)
Following and building upon [How To GraphQL Tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction)

Currently building hackernews-node backend of project

## Getting up and running locally
### Init Prisma (skip this step)

```
npx prisma init
```

Note that in this repo.

<sup>This command has already been run. When it was run, it created a directory called `prisma` that contained a file called `schema.prisma`. In this repo this file has since been modified.</sup>

<sup>The command also created the file `.env`. Please note that`.env` is NOT included in this repo as it can contain secret tokens. Also note that `.env` has been added to `.gitignore` to prevent the accidental pushing of `.env` to a public repo.</sup>


Please rename`example.env` to `.env` 

There are currently 2 variables in this file that are used by this application. Go ahead and alter them as required.


### Migrate db to prisma
Create/update db `--name` is an optional param
```
npx prisma migrate dev --name "init" --preview-feature
```

### Generate/Update Prisma Client 
Creates `node_modules/@prisma/client`. This is imported into the code
```
npx prisma generate
```

### To Explore data in Prisma Studio
```
npx prisma studio
```

### To Run GraphQL Playground
```
node src/index.js
```

#### Example Queries, Mutations & Subscriptions

##### 1. Get info
```

  info
}

##### 2. Sign up as a new user

      email
      name
    }
  }
}
```

##### 3. Login as created user

Make not of token

In some of the following requests you will need to mimic being logged in, to do so:

```
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer __TOKEN__"
}
```
